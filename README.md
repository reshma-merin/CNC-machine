# MachineMind — CNC Predictive Maintenance System

> **Giving the machine a brain.**  
> An AI system that predicts CNC machine failures, catches dangerous operator inputs before they cause damage, and tells you exactly what to do when something goes wrong.

## What is MachineMind?

MachineMind is an end-to-end predictive maintenance system built for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) milling machines. It solves three problems that every manufacturing floor faces every day:

1. **Wrong operator inputs** — operators manually type machine settings before every job. One wrong value destroys a $500K machine or scraps a $10K part. No existing system checks the input before the job starts.
2. **Silent machine failures** — tools wear down, sensors drift, temperatures creep up. Machines fail mid-job with zero warning.
3. **Useless alerts** — current systems say something broke but cannot tell you what caused it, which part failed, or what to do next.

MachineMind handles all three — in real time — before the damage is done.

## How It Works

### Two-Layer Safety System

**Layer 1 — Rule-based validation (instant)**
Before the AI runs, every operator-entered parameter is checked against safe operating ranges. Values outside the range are blocked immediately — no model needed, no latency.

| Parameter | Safe Range |
|---|---|
| Air temperature | 295 – 305 K |
| Process temperature | 305 – 315 K |
| Rotational speed | 1,200 – 2,800 RPM |
| Torque | 10 – 70 Nm |
| Tool wear | 0 – 240 min |

**Layer 2 — 4 AI models running in parallel**
After a reading passes the range check, four machine learning models analyse it simultaneously:

| Model | Type | Task | Performance |
|---|---|---|---|
| BiLSTM | PyTorch deep learning | Failure prediction | AUC: 0.97 |
| Conv1D Autoencoder | PyTorch deep learning | Anomaly detection | AUC: 0.97 |
| Random Forest (200 trees) | scikit-learn | Wrong parameter combinations | AUC: 0.9999 |
| Gradient Boosting Regressor | scikit-learn | Remaining useful life (RUL) | R²: 0.9999, MAE: 0.002 min |

## Dataset

**AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset** — UCI Machine Learning Repository (ID: 601)

- 10,000 real CNC machine sensor readings
- 9 features after engineering (5 raw + 4 derived)
- 3.39% overall failure rate
- 5 labeled failure modes: TWF, HDF, PWF, OSF, RNF

**Feature engineering adds 4 derived features:**
- `power_W` = torque × (RPM × 2π / 60)
- `temp_delta_K` = process temp − air temp
- `wear_rate` = tool wear / 240
- `torque_x_rpm` = torque × RPM

**Data split:** 70% train / 15% validation / 15% test — stratified by failure label.

## Failure Modes

| Code | Name | Description | Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| TWF | Tool Wear Failure | Tool wear exceeds safe limit | Replace cutting tool immediately |
| HDF | Heat Dissipation Failure | Coolant or heat exchange failure | Check coolant system, reduce spindle speed |
| PWF | Power Failure | Spindle motor or electrical fault | Check motor, verify voltage, reduce torque load |
| OSF | Overstrain Failure | Mechanical overload | Reduce torque setpoint, decrease feed rate |
| RNF | Random Failure | Unknown or intermittent fault | Run full diagnostic cycle |

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/MachineMind
cd MachineMind
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 1 — Preprocess the data

```bash
python data/preprocess.py
```

Downloads the AI4I 2020 dataset automatically, engineers features, creates train/val/test splits. Takes about 2 minutes.

### Step 2 — Train all 4 models

```bash
python models/train_all.py
```

Trains LSTM, Autoencoder, Random Forest, and GBR sequentially. All results logged to MLflow. Takes about 5–10 minutes on CPU.

### Step 3 — Start the API

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000 --reload
```

### Step 4 — Start the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

### Step 5 — Connect Tableau (optional)

```bash
cd tableau
python -m http.server 9000
```

In Tableau Desktop → Connect → Web Data Connector → `http://localhost:9000/machinemind_wdc.html`

### Docker (all-in-one)

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Starts API (port 8000), Streamlit (port 8501), and MLflow UI (port 5000).

      "root_cause": "High tool wear + torque combination"
    }
  ],
  "solutions": [
    "Inspect cutting tool for wear — replace if wear > 200 min",
    "Check coolant flow to cutting zone",
    "Reduce feed rate by 15% to lower mechanical stress"
  ]
}
```

## Alert Thresholds

| Signal | Warning | Critical |
|---|---|---|
| Failure risk | > 30% | > 60% |
| Anomaly score | > 0.40 | > 0.70 |
| Wrong param probability | > 0.40 | > 0.65 |
| RUL remaining | < 60 min | < 20 min |

---

## Tableau Dashboard

The live Tableau dashboard connects to the FastAPI via a Web Data Connector and pulls 4 live tables:

| Table | Contents |
|---|---|
| machines | Current status, severity, all scores per machine |
| alerts | All active alerts with type, severity, root cause, instant solution |
| work_orders | Auto-generated work orders with priority, ETA, actions |
| predictions_history | Full time-series of every prediction made |

**5 charts built:**
- Fleet risk bar chart (failure risk per machine, colored by severity)
- RUL countdown (tool life remaining per machine)
- Alerts by type (count of each alert type, colored critical/warning)
- Wrong parameter probability per machine
- RUL trend over time (line chart per machine)

---

## Demo

### Live feed (continuous)

```bash
python scripts/demo_live_feed.py
```

Simulates 6 CNC machines sending sensor readings every 3 seconds. CNC-02 and CNC-05 degrade over time.

### Scripted 4-minute demo

```bash
python scripts/demo_scripted.py
```

Runs a scripted 3-phase demo:
- **Phase 1 (0:00–1:30):** All machines healthy, CNC-02 slowly degrades green → red
- **Phase 2 (1:30–2:30):** Wrong parameter entry on CNC-03, blocked instantly
- **Phase 3 (2:30–4:00):** CNC-05 tool wear races to critical, RUL hits zero

The terminal prints coaching messages telling you exactly when to refresh Tableau and what to say.
